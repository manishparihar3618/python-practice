# 🧠 Conditionals in Python

This folder contains beginner-level Python programs that explain how decision-making works using **conditional statements**.

Conditional statements allow a program to **make decisions** and perform **different actions** depending on whether a condition is true or false.

---

## 📚 What Are Conditionals?

In Python, conditionals are used to check situations like:
- Is a number positive?
- Is the user old enough?
- Does a choice match something?

Based on the result, the program can follow different paths.

## 🧩 Topics Included in This Folder

1. ### `if-else`
   - Basic two-way decision-making.

2. ### `if-elif-else`
   - Multiple conditions checked one by one.

3. ### `nested if`
   - An `if` statement inside another `if`.

4. ### `match-case`
   - Cleaner way to check multiple exact matches (Python 3.10+).

5. ### `shorthand if-else`
   - One-line version of `if-else`.

---

## 🖥️ What These Programs Do

- Take input from the user.
- Use different types of conditionals to process the input.
- Show output based on the condition that matches.

---

## 🎯 Why This Is Important

Understanding conditionals is **essential for learning how programs think**. Almost every program uses them to:
- Make decisions
- Validate input
- Control program flow

---

## ▶️ How to Use

- Open and run each Python file in this folder.
- Follow the input instructions shown in the terminal.
- Read the code and comments to understand how the logic works.
