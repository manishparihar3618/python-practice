#if-else:- sometimes the programmer need to cheak the evaluation of certian expressions(s). whelther the expression(s) evalutes to True or False, the program execution follows a different path than it would have if the expression had evaluated to True.
# elif:- sometimes, the programmer may want to evaluate more than one condition, this can be done using an elif statement.
# working of an elif statement
# execute the block of code inside if statement if the initial expression evalutes to True.just read first condition which will be of if. if its true then dont read next elifs or else.
#  execute the block of code inside elif statment.if if statment which is return above it does not evaluated true then compiler will read this one. if it holds true and matches condition then it will be executed  
# there can be multiple elif statment if above elif and if statment do not match condition then complier will read this and suppose this satisfy so it will be executed 
# .
# .
# . there can be multiple elif 
#else this code will be only be executed when all codes above are readed by compliler and no one satisfy the conditions .
#Nested if else statment we can use if, if-else,elif statment inside others if statments as well.
