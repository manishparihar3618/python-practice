#The break statment enables a program to skip over a part of a code . a break statement terminates the very loop it lies within.
for i in range(12):
    if(i==10):
        break 
    print(i+1)

# we easily see that the after applying  if condition the loop got breaks and our programm did not executed . 
# for i in range(12):
#     if(i==10):
#         break 
#     print("5 X", i+1,"=",5*(i+1))
