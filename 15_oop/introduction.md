# # why Object Oreinted program(OOP) have edge over Procedure Oreinted Programming(POP) 








# # Ojects and Classes
Class:- it is a blue print
object :- it is a real world entity
Ex:-
Class teacher 
  name
  dept
  subject
  salary

main()
 teacher 1 
 teacher 2 
 teacher 3



🚗 Example: Toyota Car Manufacturing Company

Class (Blueprint)
A class is like a blueprint or template.
For Toyota, the blueprint of a car model might say:

Every car will have 4 doors

Every car will have a 1000cc engine

Every car will run on petrol

👉 This defines the general properties and behaviors of all cars of that model, but no real car exists yet.

Object (Actual Car)
An object is an actual product created from the class (blueprint).
For example, when Toyota manufactures cars using that blueprint, each car on the road is an object.

Car 1 → chassis number CH123, engine number EN987

Car 2 → chassis number CH124, engine number EN988

Car 3 → chassis number CH125, engine number EN989

👉 All cars share the same features from the class, but each has its own unique identity (chassis no., engine no.).

📌 Final Understanding

Class = Design / Blueprint (Defines what features every car will have)

Object = Real-world Instance (Each manufactured car with its own identity)
